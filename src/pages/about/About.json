  "profileDescription": "I'm a student at the University of Toronto enrolled in the computer science specialist program. I'm very passionate about my program and it’s pretty much all I do on my free time.\n\nI’ve most recently spent the majority of my free time working St. James Town Community Corner (SJTCC) to develop an app for them. SJTCC is a non-profit organization that aids the town’s occupants with free\nservices such as doctor’s clinics, English/music/programming lessons, and daycare. Many of St. James Town’s occupants are refugees so they do not have access to free services and programs that many of us do. The language barrier often discourages refugee occupants from coming into SJTCC and inquiring about those services so the SJT Connect app was built so occupants can use the app in their native language to browse/signup SJTCC’s programs and services and also get information on their building such as the management group’s contact info, superintendent’s contact info, etc. SJT Connect is built for both platforms using React Native and is now available on the Google Play Store and will be on the Apple App Store at the discretion of SJTCC.\n\nCurrently, I’m a bartender at the Yonge & Eglinton VIP Cineplex and I love my job. I discovered I love making drinks when I first worked at Chatime (Bubble tea shop) and from there I got into bartending, which led me to my other jobs working at El Catrin, Fifth Social Club, and Cineplex VIP Bartender"
